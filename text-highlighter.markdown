Text highlighter
----------------
I've always liked the "Medium" approach to highlighting text and making notes but I never quite knew how it works so I experimented a bit in my spare time.
This implementation is not production ready, it has only been tested on latest FF and Chrome where it had noticable bugs. 

As said, this was just an exploration into trying to remake Medium's solution and explore the options.

I hope you like it, fork it and hopefully some day use it in production ;)
